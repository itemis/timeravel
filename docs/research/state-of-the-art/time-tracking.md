# Features
- Overtime calculation
    - The user shall be able to easily deduce for a certain day the overtime incurred via a separate view that shall show the overtime per project, week and days and the resulting free days.
- The user shall be able to input working time and to receive notifications when he's not logging time on any task while on working time.

## Timely
- Integration to facilitate tracking time passed but not logged yet
    -  The application shall enable integration with different services to show the user where and when he has spent time to facilitate recalling the activity time shall be logged on e.g. Moves is an app that enables knowing where time was spent during the day and where and hence the user can use this information to recall what activities time was spent on. The other example would be enabling the user to see e-mail exchanges during a certain time interval to help him recall what he was up to at that time. 


## Everhour
- Time rounding
    - the tool shall round the time down or up if the user's desire is so by an amount specified by the user.
- The tool shall allow the visualization of the task being currently tracked by the other people in the team.
    - Rationale:
        -  Avoid redundant work
- Integration features
    - The app shall allow referring tasks and projects from different sources, including other project management projects.

- Ideas for reporting features can be found [here](https://everhour.com/sample-reports): I won't be elaborating as they are not really relevant to time tracking but rather to team's time tracking by a project manager. 
## PayDirt

- Intelligent reminders
    - The application shall be able to make informed suggestions according to the current user actions in regards to what task he should be logging time on. e.g. if the user has an app browser extension active and he's googling meanwhile the keyword Angular, the extension should at best be able to make the suggestion that he starts logging time on the Angular research task if no time is currently being logged on it.

## Toggl
- The application shall be able to support team members
    - as to allow e.g. a project leader to have an overview of the times spent by the team members on the different projects or tasks
    - as to allow team members to log time onto the same task for example
- The user shall be able to enter Time entries either using a timer or by manual entry
    - A time entry shall support linking to a specific project
    - A time entry shall support linking to a specific customer
    - A time entry shall support linking to custom tags added on the fly to the pull request

- Dashboard and reporting
    - A dashboard view of the time entries shall be provided enabling the user to see an overview of the time tracked by project, week and days. Additionally, graphical representations of the percentages of time spent shall also be provided to give an overview of the activities consuming the most time.
    - A reporting view shall be provided offering the possibility to show reports that are filtered by project, tasks, client, teams or members or a combination of all these elements together. The possibility to export these reports to the existing BlueAnt shall also be made possible.

## Harvest

An initial overview of Harvest show similarities with the ideas of Toggl in terms of simplicity of the UI and the possibility to add time entries associated with projects/customers.

### Harvest Forecast
- The application shall enable associating time tracked to existing planning
- The user shall be able to tracks his progress through time and to visualize the difference between that and the initial plans
- The user shall have the possibility to set reminders at their pace for them to log their own personal time. Such a feature could also be configurable by a team if all team members agree to it.

# Tools comparison

- Between Toggl's approach and timely calendar-centered approach, I prefer personally Toggl's as it is easy to get started with it and feels more intuitive.
