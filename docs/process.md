# Timeravel Software Development Process

This file documents the overall process, procedures, rules, and conventions to be followed within the Timeravel project.


## General Process Framework

The overall process is based on the SCRUM framework. However, due to *Timeravel* being a "*Plus One*" project, the participating developers will only be able to dedicate one working day per week -- at the most -- to the project. Therefore, some adjustments are made. For instance, there will be no Daily Scrum. Also, the roles of Scrum Master and Product Owner will not be filled. Instead, the team as a whole is responsible for observing the process rules agreed upon, and for coming up with requirements and checking that the ongoing work remains geared towards fulfilling the project's objectives. As the project progresses, colleagues interested in the project may assume a customer's role. Another difference is that the team members will likely work at different times and places on the project, and collaboration will thus be limited. This means that user stories and tasks will usually be more closely associated with one responsible developer at the outset of each sprint. To still facilitate a minimum of collaboration, regular *pair programming* sessions are encouraged.

Other practices of SCRUM remain largely the same, e.g. breaking down requirements into *user stories* that will be used to fill the *product backlog*.

Besides fulfilling the product-based requirements, an expressed aim of *Timeravel* is for all participants to learn about technologies they are not yet familiar with. To this end, participants are encouraged to commit themselves to one or more *learning objectives*, and choose their tasks and the technologies used to implement them, accordingly.

### Dates and Development Cycles

As in SCRUM, development will occur iteratively through *sprints*. A sprint will usually last between a month or two. The actual length is decided upon by the team, at the beginning of each sprint, based on the set goals, tasks, and under consideration of its participants' commitments outside of *Timeravel*.

#### Sprint Meeting

The sprint meeting takes place at the end of each sprint, and serves as kick-off for the next sprint. It will be prepared and moderated by a different team member every time. It generally follows this agenda:

1. Result presentations
    * Every developer should give a short(!) presentation of his results, which should be a useable increment of the overall product or one of its components, and satisfy the team's *definition of done*.
	    * The other team members should provide feedback, and may take on a Product Owner-like role, i.e. judge whether the work satisfies the corresponding user stories, and if it should be considered done, or if it needs to be revised. The final decision is made by the team as a whole.
	* In addition, everyone should briefly summarize what he learned during the sprint, particularly (but not exclusively) with respect to his learning objectives.
2. Retrospective
    * As in SCRUM, the retrospectives provides an opportunity to discuss issues with the process, and potentially agree on changing it to solve them.
3. Planning and Estimation
    * The team decides on the goals for the upcoming sprint.
	    * In addition, participants may also decide to commit to a new learning objective.
	* User stories fitting those goals are selected from the product backlog and put into the sprint backlog.
	    * New user stories that may have come up can also be created, either to be included in the sprint right away, or to be put into the product backlog.
		* On this occasion, the product backlog should also be cleared of user stories that are not considered relevant anymore ("*backlog grooming*").
	    * User stories without an estimation need to be estimated before being put into the sprint backlog. The team decides on the estimation process, e.g. story point-based *planning poker*, or a simplified version of it. Due to the nature of the project, team members will work on issues alone, most of the time. Participants are therefore encouraged to keep track of their individual *velocity* to avoid taking on too much work for one sprint.

#### Sync Meeting

A short stand-up meeting of approximately ten to twenty minutes will be held every second Friday. This meeting replaces the Daily Scrum, and serves the same purpose of getting all developers up to speed, and to identify potiential impediments.
