# Introduction
This is a living document summarizing our technology choices for implementing timeravel and the rationale behind them.

# Frontend

We are currently assessing several technologies for implementing the frontend of our application. As some of our team members are familiar with [Angular](https://angular.io/ "Angular Homepage"). We are currently considering it as a potential candidate.

# Backend

To implement our backend we are currently considering either [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/ "Node Homepage") or Java Web Technlogies as potential candidates.
